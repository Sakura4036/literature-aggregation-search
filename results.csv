An Optimal Control View of Adversarial Machine Learning,Xiaojin Zhu (N/A),2018,arXiv,,,1811.04422v1,"I describe an optimal control view of adversarial machine learning, where the
dynamical system is the machine learner, the input are adversarial actions, and
the control costs are defined by the adversary's goals to do harm and be hard
to detect. This view encompasses many types of adversarial machine learning,
including test-item attacks, training-data poisoning, and adversarial reward
shaping. The view encourages adversarial machine learning researcher to utilize
advances in control theory and reinforcement learning.",0,arxiv

useful for solving clinical prediction problems, (2) understand the intuition
behind some machine learning models, including regression, decision trees, and
support vector machines, and (3) understand how to apply these models to
clinical prediction problems using publicly available datasets via case

Towards Modular Machine Learning Solution Development: Benefits and Trade-offs,Samiyuru Menik (N/A); Lakshmish Ramaswamy (N/A),2023,arXiv,,,2301.09753v1,"Machine learning technologies have demonstrated immense capabilities in
various domains. They play a key role in the success of modern businesses.
However, adoption of machine learning technologies has a lot of untouched
potential. Cost of developing custom machine learning solutions that solve
unique business problems is a major inhibitor to far-reaching adoption of
machine learning technologies. We recognize that the monolithic nature
prevalent in today's machine learning applications stands in the way of
efficient and cost effective customized machine learning solution development.
In this work we explore the benefits of modular machine learning solutions and
discuss how modular machine learning solutions can overcome some of the major
solution engineering limitations of monolithic machine learning solutions. We
analyze the trade-offs between modular and monolithic machine learning
solutions through three deep learning problems; one text based and the two
image based. Our experimental results show that modular machine learning
solutions have a promising potential to reap the solution engineering
advantages of modularity while gaining performance and data advantages in a way
the monolithic machine learning solutions do not permit.",0,arxiv
Personalized Prediction of Response to Smartphone-Delivered Meditation Training: Randomized Controlled Trial,Christian A. Webb (N/A); M. Hirshberg (N/A); R. Davidson (N/A); Simon B. Goldberg (N/A),2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,10.2196/41566,36346668,,"Background Meditation apps have surged in popularity in recent years, with an increasing number of individuals turning to these apps to cope with stress, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps for depression and anxiety. However, little is known about who is well suited to these apps. Objective This study aimed to develop and test a data-driven algorithm to predict which individuals are most likely to benefit from app-based meditation training. Methods Using randomized controlled trial data comparing a 4-week meditation app (Healthy Minds Program [HMP]) with an assessment-only control condition in school system employees (n=662), we developed an algorithm to predict who is most likely to benefit from HMP. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were submitted to a machine learning model to develop a “Personalized Advantage Index” (PAI) reflecting an individual’s expected reduction in distress (primary outcome) from HMP versus control. Results A significant group × PAI interaction emerged (t658=3.30; P=.001), indicating that PAI scores moderated group differences in outcomes. A regression model that included repetitive negative thinking as the sole baseline predictor performed comparably well. Finally, we demonstrate the translation of a predictive model into personalized recommendations of expected benefit. Conclusions Overall, the results revealed the potential of a data-driven algorithm to inform which individuals are most likely to benefit from a meditation app. Such an algorithm could be used to objectively communicate expected benefits to individuals, allowing them to make more informed decisions about whether a meditation app is appropriate for them.

Abstractive text summarization of low-resourced languages using deep learning,Nida Shafiq (N/A); Isma Hamid (N/A); Muhammad Asif (N/A); Qamar Nawaz (N/A); Hanan Aljuaid (N/A); Hamid Ali (N/A),2023,PeerJ Computer Science,10.7717/peerj-cs.1176,37346684,,"Background Humans must be able to cope with the huge amounts of information produced by the information technology revolution. As a result, automatic text summarization is being employed in a range of industries to assist individuals in identifying the most important information. For text summarization, two approaches are mainly considered: text summarization by the extractive and abstractive methods. The extractive summarisation approach selects chunks of sentences like source documents, while the abstractive approach can generate a summary based on mined keywords. For low-resourced languages, e.g., Urdu, extractive summarization uses various models and algorithms. However, the study of abstractive summarization in Urdu is still a challenging task. Because there are so many literary works in Urdu, producing abstractive summaries demands extensive research. Methodology This article proposed a deep learning model for the Urdu language by using the Urdu 1 Million news dataset and compared its performance with the two widely used methods based on machine learning, such as support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). The results show that the suggested deep learning model performs better than the other two approaches. The summaries produced by extractive summaries are processed using the encoder-decoder paradigm to create an abstractive summary. Results With the help of Urdu language specialists, the system-generated summaries were validated, showing the proposed model’s improvement and accuracy.",19,semantic_scholar

We specifically focus on the principal Machine learning based risk scores used in cardiovascular research. After introducing them and summarizing their assumptions and biases, we discuss their merits and shortcomings. We report on how frequently they are adopted in the field and suggest why this is the case based on our expertise in machine learning. We complete the analysis by reviewing how corresponding statistical approaches compare with them. Finally, we discuss the main open issues in applying machine learning tools to cardiology tasks, also drafting possible future directions. Despite the growing interest in these tools, we argue that there are many still underutilized techniques: while neural networks are slowly being incorporated in cardiovascular research, other important techniques such as semi-supervised learning and federated learning are still underutilized. The former would allow practitioners to harness the information contained in large datasets that are only partially labeled, while the latter would foster collaboration between institutions allowing building larger and better models.', 'structured': []}",0,pubmed
